# Note that using the raw and non-raw coefs would not affect the model in a meaningful way
# To find a suitable degree for the polynomial regression, we could use hypothesis tests.
# Here is an example of doing this using ANOVA (analysis of variance, using F-test)
# This tests the null hypothesis that model M1 is sufficient against the alternative hypothesis
# that a more complex model M2 is required.
# M1 and M2 must be nested models - predictors in M1 a subset of predictors in M2.

# However, in this case we can use the fact that poly creates orthogonal polynomials.
# The p-values for the coefs here are the same as in ANOVA
# Anova works also when we have non-orthogonal polynomials though

# Finally, note that we could also use cross validation for selecting polynomial degree

# The book goes one to create a binary predictor with
# family = binomial, and uses some fancy function for creating CI's.
# Will not bother with that here.
